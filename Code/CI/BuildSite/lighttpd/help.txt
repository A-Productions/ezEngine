Install lighttpd ("apt-get install lighttpd" will do)
Copy the content of this folder to "/etc/lighttpd"
Make sure to move all files in "/etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled" to "/etc/lighttpd/conf-available" as we want none of them.
The website content (content of "/BuildSite") is assumted to be placed in "/var/www/" and the user 'pi' has read/write access to it.

To generate a password file used by the config:
cd /etc/lighttpd/.htpasswd
./hash.sh '' 'site' 'PW'
With PW being replaced by the password we want to use for the 'site' realm.
This will generate the lighttpd-htdigest.user file in the same folder.

The lighttpd service can be stopped with:
  sudo /etc/init.d/lighttpd stop
And restarted with:
  sudo /etc/init.d/lighttpd restart
Once stopped, the service can be run on the command line for debugging with:
  export BUILDSITE_SETTINGS=/var/www/settings.cfg
  sudo /usr/sbin/lighttpd-angel -D -f /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
