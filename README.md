ezEngine
========

An open source game engine in early development.


NOTE: The github repository is only a mirror of our released milestones at http://ezEngine.net.
We do not actively use github during development.

Therefore, pull requests might get accepted, but not directly integrated into the github repository, but will rather be integrated into the main Subversion branch and then only be syncronized back to github with the next release.
