What's New {#WhatsNew}
==========

Milestone 3
-----------
  
  * Added an input abstraction system (ezInputManager, ezInputDevice, etc.).
     * Implements mouse/keyboard and XBox 360 controller on Windows.
     * Contains ezVirtualThumbStick, which can be used on touch devices for 'controller input'.
     * Can be extended through additional ezInputDevice's to handle more platforms and device types.
  * Added the basics of a game object system (ezWorld, ezGameObject, ezComponent). The Asteroids game sample already shows how to do a simple game with it. The system is not yet complete but good enough for now.     
  * Added a sample game, similar to Asteroids, to show how to use the Game Object system and the Input System.
  * Added ezCompressedStreamReader and ezCompressedStreamWriter, which allow to (un-)compress data while writing/reading a file or memory stream.
  * Asserts can now be intercepted with an Assert Handler
  * Many subsystems (ezOSFile, ezInputManager, ezCVar) now broadcast more info about the status via ezEvent so that introspection becomes possible.
  * ezEvent can now be used with a locking policy, if thread-safety is required.
  * Added ezTelemetry, a system that allows to broadcast information about the application to interested other applications via network. Once connected, communication can go both ways to modify the application behavior.
  * Added ezStats, an easy system to store information about the current application state (player health, ammo, AI status, ...). This can be transmitted via ezTelemetry (or other tools) and displayed in a convenient way for better debugging.
  * Added ezInspector, a tool that can display information about ezStats, ezCVar, ezLog messages, ezSubSystem, ezPlugin, ezGlobalEvent, ezOSFile, memory allocations an asserts. It can be run in parallel to a game, either on the same PC or a different one and connect via TCP to the application that will then transmit that information.
  * Added ezInspectorPlugin, the engine-side plugin that enables the introspection features required to communicate with ezInspector.
  * Added a Qt GUI for the testframework.
  * Added ezApplication, a basic application abstraction.
  * Added ezWindow, a basic window abstraction.
  * Changed ezMemoryStreamStorage, ezMemoryStreamReader and ezMemoryStreamWriter to allow to use them in more complicated code and without allocations in many situations.
  * Added ezRectTemplate and ezSizeTemplate for rect and size types.
  * Added ezMemoryUtils::DefaultConstruct which will always default construct objects, even POD types such as int, float, etc.
  * Added ezMemoryUtils::ByteCompare to do a real byte compare even on class types.
  * Added 'ThirdParty' library.
    * Included zlib for zip compression.
    * Included enet for network communication.
  * Added 'System' library.
    * Currently only includes ezWindow.
  * Added ezDelegate for callbacks that work with static functions and member functions.
  * Fixed some code analysis warnings with Visual Studio 2012.
  * Fixed several bugs.
  * New ezVariant type that is much more powerful and useful than the previous implementation.
  * Added ezConversionUtils class for converting strings to int/float/bool.
  

Milestone 2
-----------

  * Added CVars (global configuration variables)
  * Added Plugin loading / unloading / reloading
  * Added GPA integration for profiling
  * Added Reloadable global variables for plugins
  * Added Bitfield Container
  * Added generic Id class and Id mapping table
  * Added Stack Tracing for better memory leak detection
  * Added Mac Port (mostly)
  * Added Application Entry Point abstraction (main / WinMain)
  * Added Task Pool System
  * Added BMP Writer
  * Added Fixed Point type
  * All math classes are now templated, allowing double as internal type
  * Added ezVec2d, ezVec3d, ezVec4d, ezPlaned, ezQuatd, ezMat3d, ezMat4d, ezBoundingBoxd, ezBoundingSphered
  * New Libraries: Core, CoreUtils
  * Added ezLargeBlockAllocator
  * Implemented a proper hashing function for strings
  * Added ezSystemInformation to report CPU core count, Available RAM, etc.
  * Added features to the build system to work with Qt5
  * Added ezThreadSignal for inter-thread synchronization
  * Fixed several bugs.
